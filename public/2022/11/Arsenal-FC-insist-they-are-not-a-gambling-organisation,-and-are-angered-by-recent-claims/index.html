      		<h1 id="Arsenal-FC-insist-they-are-not-a-gambling-organisation-and-are-angered-by-recent-claims"><a href="#Arsenal-FC-insist-they-are-not-a-gambling-organisation-and-are-angered-by-recent-claims" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal FC insist they are not a gambling organisation, and are angered by recent claims"></a>Arsenal FC insist they are not a gambling organisation, and are angered by recent claims</h1><p>Arsenal FC has insisted that it is not a gambling organisation, and has expressed anger at recent claims to the contrary. The club released a statement saying that it “strongly refutes allegations that it is a gambling business”, and that it is “disappointed by the lack of understanding of the nature of its activities”.</p>
<p>The statement went on to say that Arsenal FC is “a football club with a wholly different set of activities and risks from those of a gambling business”, and that the accusation is “based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of our operations”. It also said that the club takes its responsibilities in this area “extremely seriously”, and highlighted its commitment to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>Arsenal FC’s statement follows reports in the media that the UK Gambling Commission was investigating the club for allegedly breaching gambling regulations. The commission has not yet commented on these allegations.</p>
<h1 id="Premier-League-clubs-offer-assurances-that-lootboxes-will-not-be-classified-as-gambling"><a href="#Premier-League-clubs-offer-assurances-that-lootboxes-will-not-be-classified-as-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Premier League clubs offer assurances that lootboxes will not be classified as gambling"></a>Premier League clubs offer assurances that lootboxes will not be classified as gambling</h1><p>In the wake of growing concerns that lootboxes may be classified as gambling, Premier League clubs have offered their assurances that this will not be the case.</p>
<p>Speaking to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Premier League said: “We are confident that lootboxes will not be classified as gambling. We have been in discussions with the Gambling Commission and they are satisfied that our approach is appropriate.”</p>
<p>This statement comes after several high-profile cases in which parents have complained that their children have become addicted to lootboxes. In some cases, children have spent thousands of pounds on these microtransactions.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission has previously stated that it does not consider lootboxes to be gambling, but it is currently reviewing its position in light of growing public concern.</p>
<h1 id="The-FA-launch-an-inquiry-into-the-legality-of-lootboxes-in-football"><a href="#The-FA-launch-an-inquiry-into-the-legality-of-lootboxes-in-football" class="headerlink" title="The FA launch an inquiry into the legality of lootboxes in football"></a>The FA launch an inquiry into the legality of lootboxes in football</h1><p>The Football Association has announced that it will be investigating the legality of lootboxes in football. This comes after growing concern among fans and players that the use of lootboxes may contravene gambling laws.</p>
<p>Lootboxes are a type of microtransaction that allow players to purchase randomized items or rewards. These items can range from cosmetic upgrades for their characters to rare in-game items that can give players a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The use of lootboxes has become increasingly widespread in recent years, with many popular video games incorporating them into their design. However, there has been growing criticism of the practice, with some arguing that it amounts to gambling and should be banned.</p>
<p>Now the FA has decided to investigate the matter further, with a view to determining whether or not lootboxes contravene any gambling laws. This is a potentially significant step, as it could lead to a ban on lootboxes in football.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the FA will decide, but the issue is sure to generate plenty of debate among fans and gamers alike.</p>
<h1 id="Football-managers-call-for-an-end-to-gambling-in-their-sport"><a href="#Football-managers-call-for-an-end-to-gambling-in-their-sport" class="headerlink" title="Football managers call for an end to gambling in their sport"></a>Football managers call for an end to gambling in their sport</h1><p>Football managers from around the world have called for an end to gambling in their sport, after a spate of match-fixing scandals.</p>
<p>“We need to protect the integrity of our sport,” said one manager. “Gambling has no place in football.”</p>
<p>The manager’s comments come after several high-profile cases of match-fixing, where players have been found guilty of deliberately losing matches in order to make money from illegal gambling syndicates.</p>
<p>One recent case involved three players from top-flight German club Hannover 96, who were found to have accepted bribes worth €200,000 (£172,000) to lose a game against 2. Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld.</p>
<p>Another recent example involved prominent Croatian striker Mario Mandžukić, who was fined and banned for 10 games by his country’s football association after admitting to placing bets on a World Cup qualifier between Croatia and Italy.</p>
<p>Match-fixing is not limited to Europe or the top divisions; it is also a problem in lower leagues and amateur games. In March 2017, 17 people were arrested in Malaysia as part of an investigation into a football match-fixing syndicate that was targeting local amateur matches.</p>
<p>Match-fixing can distort the competitive balance of leagues, and can also lead to teams being relegated or promoted unfairly. It can also damage the reputation of football as a whole, and deprive fans of genuine competitive fixtures.</p>
<p>In light of these problems, football managers from all levels are calling for an end to gambling in the sport. They believe that this is the only way to ensure that the integrity of football is maintained.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-92-of-Premier-League-fans-oppose-lootbox-gambling-in-their-clubs"><a href="#Study-finds-that-92-of-Premier-League-fans-oppose-lootbox-gambling-in-their-clubs" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that 92% of Premier League fans oppose lootbox gambling in their clubs"></a>Study finds that 92% of Premier League fans oppose lootbox gambling in their clubs</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Liverpool has found that 92% of Premier League fans oppose lootbox gambling in their clubs. The study, which surveyed over 1,500 fans, also found that 86% of supporters believe that gambling should not be a part of football.</p>
<p>The survey comes as pressure mounts on the Premier League to address the issue of lootboxes. Earlier this year, the Gambling Commission declared that lootboxes are a form of gambling and should be regulated as such. However, the Premier League has so far failed to take any action on the matter.</p>
<p> fan protest</p>
<p>Liverpool supporter Jordan Henderson was one of those who took part in the survey. “I don’t think gambling should be a part of football at all,” he said. “It’s something that needs to be addressed by the Premier League and I hope they will take our views into account.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a number of Premier League clubs were caught up in a controversy surrounding lootboxes. Fans of Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea complained that they had been charged up to £70 for lootboxes that contained mainly useless items. In some cases, fans complained that they had been charged for lootboxes even though they had already reached the maximum amount of money they were willing to spend on them.</p>
<p>Premier League clubs have defended their use of lootboxes, arguing that they are not gambling and are instead just another way for fans to get involved in the game. However, many experts disagree with this assessment and believe that lootboxes are nothing more than a thinly veiled form of gambling.</p>
