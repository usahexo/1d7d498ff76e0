#  CSKA Moscow set to wheel down for sports betting

CSKA Moscow is all set to plunge into the sports betting industry by setting up a new company, CSKA Bet. The new company will be based in Malta and will have its own online platform as well as a retail arm.

The Russian Premier League club is said to have already acquired a license from the Maltese Gaming Authority and is now in the process of recruiting personnel for the new venture.

This is not CSKA Moscow’s first foray into the gambling sector. In 2016, the club set up an affiliate marketing company called CSKA Marketing which partnered with several leading online casinos.
