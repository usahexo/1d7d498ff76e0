#  Why is bitcasino.com based in Comoros?

Bitcasino.com, one of the world's leading Bitcoin casinos, is curiously based in the tiny island nation of Comoros.

Second, the country has a well-developed telecommunications infrastructure, which is necessary for running a successful online casino. And third, Comoros is exempt from most international financial sanctions, making it a safe place to do business.
