#  Mou's Madrid tweaks sees them topple Sporting

A goal in each half from Grujic and Ramos - the first via a fine header, the second a penalty - was enough to condemn Jorge Jesus' side to a first La Liga defeat of the campaign.

Gareth Bale made his return from injury as a substitute in the second half but could not help his side find an equaliser.

Madrid have now moved up to second in the table, four points behind Barcelona but with a game in hand.

Sporting have seen their early good form evaporate, and they are now eighth, three points off the European places.

#  Benfica Held To A Draw In Lisbon Derby

Matheus Pereira's spectacular late equaliser rescued a point for Sporting CP in a pulsating 2-2 draw with Benfica in the Lisbon derby on Saturday.

Rui Vitoria's side looked to be on their way to victory after goals from Pizzi and Haris Seferovic, but Sporting fought back in the latter stages to take a share of the spoils.

Pereira was the hero, curling home a delightful effort with six minutes remaining to deny Benfica the chance to move three points clear at the top of the table.

Sporting remain second, four points behind their rivals, while Benfica are now two points clear of third-placed Braga.

#  Valencia continue their resurgence with a convincing win over Celta

Valencia CF got back to winning ways in LaLiga with a 3-0 home victory over fellow strugglers Celta Vigo. The result moves the hosts up to 12th in the table, four points clear of the relegation zone, while Celta are now just two points above the bottom three.

The opening goal arrived midway through the first half, when Goncalo Guedes’s deflected effort found the net. Valencia doubled their advantage nine minutes before the break, as Geoffrey Kondogbia swept home from 12 yards out. Santi Mina completed the scoring in stoppage time, nodding in from six yards following a pinpoint cross from Carlos Soler.

Here are three things we learned from this game:

1) Valencia are starting to look like a team again

After a disastrous start to the season, which saw them win just one of their first 12 games in all competitions, Valencia have now won three of their last four matches in LaLiga. This latest victory was arguably their most convincing yet, as they completely dominated Celta Vigo and created plenty of chances.

2) Goncalo Guedes is starting to make an impact

Goncalo Guedes joined Valencia on loan from Paris Saint-Germain in January and he has started to make an impact in recent weeks. The 21-year-old was impressive against Celta Vigo, with his pace and trickery causing the visitors plenty of problems. He capped off a good performance by scoring the opening goal.

3) Santi Mina is starting to find his form

Santi Mina had been struggling for goals since joining Valencia last summer, but he has now scored four goals in his last four games. The 22-year-old was lethal against Celta Vigo, bagging a brace and proving that he can be a real threat in front of goal.

#  Braga get the better of Nikola Vucevic and Oviedo

In a hotly contested Liga ACB matchup, Braga were able to get the better of Oviedo behind some hot shooting from Nikola Vucevic.

The big man for Braga was in fine form, connecting on 10 of his 16 attempts from the field including three from beyond the arc. This helped propel his side to an impressive 97-86 victory.

Vucevic was ably supported by Raul Neto who finished with 18 points and six assists while Rafa Martinez chipped in with 14 points of his own.

For Oviedo, Nikola Mirotic led the way with 25 points while Stefan Moody added 22. However, it was not enough to prevent them from slipping to their fourth defeat of the season.

#  Gregoire Defrel double helps Sassuolo see off 10-man Torino

Sassuolo got back to winning ways in Serie A, thanks in no small part to Gregoire Defrel’s brace. Defrel was joined on the scoresheet by Simone Zaza, as Torino played over half the match with 10 men.

Torino had Emanuele Giaccherini sent off midway through the first half for a second bookable offence, and Defrel made them pay for their numerical disadvantage before the break.

After Giaccherini’s dismissal, Sassuolo midfielder Alfred Duncan was also shown a red card, but it made little difference to the outcome of the game.

Zaza doubled Sassuolo’s lead soon after the restart, and Defrel completed his brace with a fine finish late on. The result moves Sassuolo up to 10th place in Serie A, while Torino remain in seventh. 

Gregoire Defrel grabbed his sixth and seventh goals of the season as Sassuolo beat 10-man Torino 3-0 at Mapei Stadium. 
The France forward netted in either half as Simone Zaza also got on the scoresheet to help Roberto De Zerbi’s side bounce back from their 4-1 home defeat to Juventus last time out. 
Emanuele Giaccherini saw red for Torino midway through the first half after picking up his second booking and Alfred Duncan followed him down the tunnel for Sassuolo shortly after the restart, but it made little difference in terms of the final result. 
Defrel opened the scoring on 36 minutes with a composed finish from close range before doubling his tally 12 minutes into the second period with an exquisite lob over Salvatore Sirigu. Zaza then put the icing on the cake deep into stoppage time to seal an impressive win for De Zerbi’s side.
