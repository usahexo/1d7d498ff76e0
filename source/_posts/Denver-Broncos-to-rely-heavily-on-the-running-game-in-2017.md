#  Denver Broncos to rely heavily on the running game in 2017

In the offseason, the Denver Broncos lost their starting quarterback, Brock Osweiler, to the Houston Texans. This left Trevor Siemian as the only QB on the roster with any experience. They also lost their top two running backs from last year, C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman, in free agency. To make matters worse, their offensive line was decimated by injuries in training camp.

Despite all of these challenges, the Broncos have managed to win their first three games of the season. They did it by relying heavily on their running game. In those three games, they have ran the ball 107 times for 449 yards (4.2 yards per carry) and 3 touchdowns.

Their running game has been led by rookie Devontae Booker, who has rushed for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns on 54 carries (4.5 yards per carry). He has been helped out by veteran Kapri Bibbs, who has rushed for 104 yards and 1 touchdown on 19 carries (5.5 yards per carry).

The Broncos' running game should continue to be a big part of their offense in 2017. They will need it to be successful if they want to make the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

#  Here are three big questions facing the Denver Broncos as they enter Week 1

The Denver Broncos are coming off a disappointing 5-11 season, but they have some big questions to answer as they enter Week 1 of the 2019 season.

1. Can Joe Flacco be the answer at quarterback?

After Case Keenum struggled mightily in 2018, the Broncos traded for Joe Flacco from the Baltimore Ravens. Flacco is a three-time Pro Bowler, but he's coming off a down year in which he threw just 12 touchdowns against six interceptions. The Broncos hope that a change of scenery will help Flacco get back to his old form.

2. Can their defense carry them again?

The Broncos have one of the best defenses in the NFL, and they'll need it to carry them if they want to return to the playoffs. Von Miller and Chris Harris Jr. are two of the best defenders in the league, and they'll need to continue playing at a high level if the Broncos want to succeed.

3. Can Phillip Lindsay build on his breakout rookie season?

Phillip Lindsay was one of the few bright spots for the Broncos last season, as he rushed for 1,037 yards and nine touchdowns. He'll need to continue playing at a high level if the Broncos want to improve on their 5-11 record from last year.
